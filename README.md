An exploratory data analysis of this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018 - it's still very much a first draft, and may never be completed.

Our primary motivation for this project was to look at what predicts things like salary and job satisfaction for data scientists. This was intended as a project for the Udacity data science Nanodegree - however in the end I decided to submit my Spotify track EDA, which you can find in this repo: https://github.com/lbrutton/spotify_eda_2
